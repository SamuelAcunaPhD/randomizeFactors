% setup your experimental factors and repetitions, this will
% churn out the experimental conditions in random order for a full

% REQUIRED INPUTS:
% factor : a structure with fields for name and conditions
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS
% nRepetitions : the number of repetitions of the conditions, default is 1
% table_filename : the name of the table to save
%
% OUTPUTS:
% randomize_factors(factors,nRepetitions) : a table of randomized experimental factors will be saved to the working directory as 'table_filename.xls'
% [tTrials] = randomize_factors(factors,nRepetitions) : tTrials is the table of randomized experimental factors
% [tTrials,sTrials] = randomize_factors(factors,nRepetitions) : sTrials are strings listing the table of randomized experimental factors
%
% EXAMPLE:
% factors(1).name = 'Factor A'; % name of factor
% factors(1).conditions = {'A1','A2'}; % name the conditions
% factors(2).name = 'Factor B';
% factors(2).conditions = {'B1','B2'};
% factors(3).name = 'Factor C';
% factors(3).conditions = {'C1','C2','C3'};
% nRepetitions = 2;
% randomize_factors(factors,nRepetitions);
